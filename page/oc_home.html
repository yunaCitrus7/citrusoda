<p>Her personality is strong and assertive — cheerful, lively, clingy, playful, and a bit unpredictable.
<br>
A former Octarian squad leader, she hacked into the system after coming to the surface to erase her own records and officially leave the military.
<br>
One night, after getting drunk, she collapsed on the roadside and was rescued by a kind surface boy. From their first meeting, she felt a strange sense of attachment to him — claiming that even without knowing his name, she could tell he was “her type.” She later moved in to start a shared life with him.

Over time, their feelings deepened, and she eventually confessed and started dating him.
<br>
She has an older brother named Shuu (終) whom she’s very close to. The siblings have a strong emotional bond. However, due to temporarily losing contact after both arrived on the surface, she once resented him deeply.</p>

<p>Gentle personality, lacks confidence.
<br>
An only child, Yuuhi lost his mother to illness when he was just 2 years old. His father later fell into gambling, leaving the family burdened with massive debt.
<br>
At the age of 14, his father disappeared without a word, and the debt collectors came knocking. From that point on, Yuuhi began a life of non-stop part-time work to pay off what was left behind.
<br>
Due to long-term overwork and lack of sleep, he often has dark circles under his eyes. Outside of work, he tends to be slow and a little spacey — but he's extremely skilled in Salmon Run.
<br>
One day after work, he encountered Musubi passed out drunk on the street. Worried about her, he took the unconscious girl home and cared for her. That’s how they met.
<br>
As they began living together, feelings slowly grew between them. After a sudden moment of realization, he finally understood his emotions and confessed to Musubi, beginning their relationship.</p>

<p>He always gives off a friendly and laid-back impression with his easy smile — though in truth, the only ones he truly relaxes around are Musubi and Yuuhi.
<br>
A former Octarian squad commander, Shuu cut ties with the military after arriving on the surface, believing he could live more freely this way. Since then, he’s made a living through Ranked Battles, relying on his exceptional combat ability to win prizes and earnings.
<br>
He has great confidence in his appearance and knows how to use that charm to his advantage, having built a wide network of strong allies and connections on the surface.
<br>
Upon learning that his younger sister Musubi had also made it to the surface, he quickly sought her out. Reunited, the siblings resumed their close bond — and, as fate would have it, found something new: a gentle happiness shared with Yuuhi, beginning a warm and unshakable life together.</p>
